Activity\tA specific task that may be a part of a larger ongoing or routine process. It is defined by a set of one or more regulated actions within an area of interest as defined by a referral agency. An activity may require one or more authorizations. Activity Bundling\tThe act of identifying the set of permits required for a certain activity.\tThis should be refined, not sure if this should belong here as it's not a formal process but a description of a relationship Application\tA submitted form(s) with the intent to obtain or amend an authorization.\tThis might be getting muddled with the concept of a project. Area of Interest\tA defined location where an action is to be performed. It may be specified by Coordinates, GeoJSON, or by Parcels.\tAddresses may potentially be usable. Authorization\tThe act of granting permission to perform a specific action in a parcel within the Province of BC. Authorizations may take various forms, including a permit, license, tenure, lease, right-of-way, agreement, grant, statutory right, interest or title.\tWe might need to expand this definition over time as this is the formal umbrella term for many things. Caseload\tWork happening with the LOB to facilitate, capture and maintain a permit. Disposition\tThe final decision or outcome made by a statutory decision maker regarding an application. It essentially indicates what action has been taken with respect to the application, and can be represented by a state.\tFirst attempt at defining - needs review License\tA formal authorization permission to engage in a particular action, often for commercial purposes. Licenses are usually granted for a set duration and can be subject to conditions, fees, and regulations. Parcel\tA polygon representation of a designated area, location or jurisdiction. Parcels may have varying degrees of accuracy which may or may not come from surveyor submissions.\tRephrased from LTSA page Permit\tA temporary, conditional authorization granting permission for a specific action within a defined period. It outlines the scope, requirements, and limitations of the action and may be subject to renewal or revocation.\tIn permitting modernization, the term broadly refers to various types of authorization. Project\tA temporary, goal-oriented effort designed to achieve a particular outcome within a defined timeframe and scope. It is defined by a set of one or more regulated actions within an area of interest as defined by a referral agency. A project may require one or more authorizations. Submission\tThe completed output of a single form as answered by an applicant.\tAdd a note like &quot;Submissions require an adjective declaring their application context&quot;? System\tA collection of interconnected software and/or hardware components that supports business operations. Permitting systems will typically facilitate the application process for a specific authorization. Tenure\tA long-term, often transferable authorization for the right to use, occupy, or control land or resources. It establishes a legal claim to land or resources, often with conditions on usage and maintenance. Workload\tA quantifiable measurement of the number of client-driven applications in the queue.\t  The following diagram outlines a high level relational map between all the actors (with rounded borders) and how they interact with specific parts of the process.

Term\tDefinitionData Type\tA primitive data type is one of the most fundamental principles for defining what type of information a piece of data is. Common data types are: boolean, integer, string, and date. Identifiers\tIdentifiers provide a shorthand way to reference a unit of data or a specific entry in a codelist or classification scheme. Typically identifiers are intended to be unique within a local or global context (UIDs, and UUIDs). This can include both UUIDs intended to serve as their own widely used standards as well as commonly used code lists and classification schemes. For example, &quot;CA&quot; is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for Canada while 515112 is the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for FM radio stations. Vocabulary\tA vocabulary establishes standardized terms with consistent semantic definitions. These are typically constrained to a particular namespace or domain. The terms are the machine readable labels for individual data elements or a group of data elements. They can be thought of as the column headings in a spreadsheet of tabular data along with their definitions in a data dictionary. For example, the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative establishes a term and definition for a variety of common metadata elements like &quot;publisher.&quot; Schema\tA schema can be a data model or database schema defining relationships between different pieces of information. Schemas can be described using SQL, UML, XSD, or JSON Schema. Format\tThe format or &quot;serialization format&quot; is the syntax, encoding, and file format or media type for storing or transmitting your data. On the web, formats are associated with standardized media type identifiers, like application/json. Common data formats include JSON, CSV, and XML. API\tAn application programming interface (API) is a predefined protocol for reading and/or writing data using a filesystem, a database, or across a network. Common types of data APIs include OBDC and SQL for databases and REST APIs for the web.

Element Instance\tA specific implementation or occurrence of a data element that adheres to its corresponding definition. It represents a concrete instance of the abstract structure defined by the Element Definition. Naming System\tA NamingSystem defines the unique identifiers (namespaces) used for codes.

The process type is conceptually aligned with the Process Tracking Code System to represent the various levels of abstractions that are possible. The hierarchical nature of these abstractions are mapped via the Application Process Concept Map to represent the various levels of abstraction that are possible.  Process tracking itself is a complex domain as it involves many different contexts and levels of abstraction. One of the Code Systems that leverage this data element is theApplication Process Code System. This is represented through a standardCoding element structure. In the Coding element, there is a code, a code_set and acode_system attribute.  The code attribute is the primary code value, while the code_set attribute is an ordered set of code symbols. The code_set attribute is an ordered set of code symbols, where the last element must match thecode. For example, the code_set value of [&quot;APPLICATION&quot;, &quot;TECH_REVIEW_COMMENT&quot;, &quot;REFERRAL&quot;] would indicate that the application process concept being conveyed is representing the REFERRAL State within theTechnical Review and Comment Stage of an Application Phase. This coding element would have a code of REFERRAL as it is the most specific and primary concept being conveyed.  The code_set attribute may be populated with fewer elements in situations where the concept being mapped represents a higher level conceptual abstraction. For example, if the code attribute is &quot;TECH_REVIEW_COMMENT&quot;, the code_setwould have a value of [&quot;APPLICATION&quot;, &quot;TECH_REVIEW_COMMENT&quot;]. In this case, this means that the conceptual idea being conveyed is the Technical Review and Comment Stage of an Application Phase. Systems reading the code_set attribute may extract a subset of the transmitted ordered array for processing since the lower level codes map to higher level hierarchical code concepts within the Application Process Code System.  The code_system attribute is a static URI reference to the documentation for the current code system being used. This URI is not intended to be machine readable as it is designed to act as a signal for human readers to see and understand the context of which terminologies and concepts are being conveyed.  The status attribute is optional, but is designed to be an explicit &quot;escape hatch&quot; for specific lines of business to share their most detailed system concepts, should they choose to do so. Statuses declared here will be implicitly mapped under the code attribute. If a status is defined, the status_code and status_description attributes may also be defined in order to assist with clarifying the status value.  Recipient systems may look at status, status_code and status_description as a reference point. However, the core intent of this data type is to ensure that the core code and code_set attributes are to be the main source of truth when handling and interpreting the data for processing.
