[![Maturity:Planning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maturity-Planning-orange)](../spec/overview#maturity)

This page provides an overview and guide to the PIES resources, operations and concepts used for representing and
communicating coded, structured data within this specification. Collectively, these concepts are used to provide a
common definition and framework for traversing the coded concepts within PIES.

## Acronyms

## Concepts

The following terms outline the main concepts used within this specification and aim to provide a common lexicon for
understanding and terminology usage.

### Actors

This section discusses the various roles that a person, group or an organization may act as within the context of PIES.

### Process Tracking

This section outlines the definitions and common vocabulary used for representing specific concepts within a process.

| Term      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lifecycle | Represents the complete ordered sequencing of phases that an application and an authorization may pass through. A lifecycle should describe the entire scope of processing that can occur from beginning to end.                                                                                                                                 |
| Phase     | A distinct period or division within a lifecycle. A phase will represent a broader set of stages and usually comes with specific objectives or outcomes. A phase shall be a defined member of a specific lifecycle.                                                                                                                              |
| Stage     | A discrete, ordered set or collection of states. A stage defines a sequential order of states that the process must go through. A stage shall be a defined member of a phase.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| State     | A description of the current condition of an application or authorization within the larger process or workflow (e.g., "Submitted", "Approved"). A state shall map to a broader stage definition.                                                                                                                                                |
| Status    | A description of the current condition or update of an application or authorization. Additional details about the current state are frequently conveyed (e.g., "Pending Review", "Under Inspection"). Statuses may be defined by the line of business. All defined statuses shall have a concept mapping to a broader state definition or above. |

each other.

| Term        | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Data Type   | A primitive data type is one of the most fundamental principles for defining what type of information a piece of data is. Common data types are: boolean, integer, string, and date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Identifiers | Identifiers provide a shorthand way to reference a unit of data or a specific entry in a codelist or classification scheme. Typically identifiers are intended to be unique within a local or global context (UIDs, and UUIDs). This can include both UUIDs intended to serve as their own widely used standards as well as commonly used code lists and classification schemes. For example, "CA" is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for Canada while 515112 is the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for FM radio stations. |
| Vocabulary  | A vocabulary establishes standardized terms with consistent semantic definitions. These are typically constrained to a particular namespace or domain. The terms are the machine readable labels for individual data elements or a group of data elements. They can be thought of as the column headings in a spreadsheet of tabular data along with their definitions in a data dictionary. For example, the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative establishes a term and definition for a variety of common metadata elements like "publisher."        |
| Schema      | A schema can be a data model or database schema defining relationships between different pieces of information. Schemas can be described using SQL, UML, XSD, or JSON Schema.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Format      | The format or "serialization format" is the syntax, encoding, and file format or media type for storing or transmitting your data. On the web, formats are associated with standardized media type identifiers, like application/json. Common data formats include JSON, CSV, and XML.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| API         | An application programming interface (API) is a predefined protocol for reading and/or writing data using a filesystem, a database, or across a network. Common types of data APIs include OBDC and SQL for databases and REST APIs for the web.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
