## Purpose

Stage is the highest-level **operational category of work** within a Phase.
It defines _what_ is currently being done on the authorization e.g., _Pre-application_, _Technical Review_, _Decision_, _Issuance_, giving a clear reference point for progress tracking.

## Usage

Stage records the **current operational step** that an authorization is undergoing within its Phase.

## Guidance

- Exactly **one** Stage is active at any moment.
- Parallel or finer-grained work categories belong in **State**, not additional Stages.
- Stages are about what type of work is happening, not when it happens (see Milestone dates).

## Properties

- **Data format**: string
- **Null**: Cannot be `null` – every authorization must have a phase.
- **Relationships:**
  - _Phase → Stage_: A Stage is a subset of a Phase (Phase → Stage is 1-to-many).
  - _Stage → State_: A State is a subset of a Stage (Stage → State is 1-to-many).
- **Change control:** an authorization may progress through successive Stages and return to an earlier Stage any number of times.
