## Purpose

To identify the key categories of activity that an authorization moves through within a given Phase. Stages provide a standardized, high-level view of authorization progression within both the Phase and the broader Lifecycle.

## Usage

Stages occur in a defined, ordered sequence within each Phase. An authorization can only be in one Stage at a time, and it progresses through the Stages in order as it moves through the process.

## Guidance

## Structure

- **stage** (string): A distinct step within a Phase that represents a key shift in the type of work being done (e.g., intake, review, decision). It helps identify where the authorization currently sits in the overall process.
