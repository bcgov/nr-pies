## Purpose

To track delays in handling applications, allowing for identification of broader issues rather than individual staff performance.
Accurate tracking helps improve processes and reduce backlog.

- Dates for when on hold have been included in the list of milestone dates.

## Usage

This level offers a high level ability to enable reporting if an application or issued authorization is active or not and the ability to determine if the application has not yet started to be worked on by the intake or authorizing agency.
Time ranges or events define the start and end of stages within the process.
