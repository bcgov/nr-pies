## Purpose

The state tracks the progress of an authorization through its entire process flow.

## Usage

The status encoding shall be arbitrarily defined by the Line of Business system.

All statuses shall have a declarative mapping with one of the four higher order process concepts (lifecycle, phase, stage, state).

## Guidance

This list is not intended to be exhaustive or a prescriptive list of all statuses enabled to support line of business process management.

This list is to create a common terminology and definitions to the minimum common events terms.

## Structure

- **state** (string): The current state of the authorization during the process and final decision.
