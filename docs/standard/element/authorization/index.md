A unique authorization name enables a common understanding of authorizations for proponents, associated authorizations
in other ministries and interoperability.

Ensure all authorization names have a uniquely defined name.

Business rules:

- Each authorization should have a formal name or concatenated name that is unique to itself.
- A authorization'sÂ name needs to be formally defined using the terms defined in the associated policy or regulation.
- Informally used names, like section numbers should not be used on their own. This leads to confusion as well the
  requirement to change namesÂ Â
