| Level | Code             | Display        | Description                                                                                 |

| 1     | `RELATED_TO`     | Related To     | The concepts are related to each other, but the exact relationship is not known.            |
| 2     | `EQUIVALENT`     | Equivalent     | The definitions of the concepts mean the same thing.                                        |
| 2     | `NARROWER_THAN`  | Narrower Than  | The source concept is narrower in meaning than the target concept.                          |
| 2     | `BROADER_THAN`   | Broader Than   | The source concept is broader in meaning than the target concept.                           |
| 1     | `NOT_RELATED_TO` | Not Related To | This is an explicit assertion that the target concept is not related to the source concept. |
