Represents an event concept. It allows either a date or a datetime, but not a mix of both. One of the start properties is required, but the end properties are optional.

## Scope

This data type is intended to represent the raw known factual information a specific temporal event. The interpretation
and context of an event will be dependent on which [resource type](../../category/resource-types) is using it.

## Structure

- An Event shall always contain some `start_*` attribute.
  - A valid Event shall at minimum contain either a `start_date` or a `start_datetime`.
- An Event shall be defined using either `date` or `date-time` specificity.
  - Mixed usage of `date` and `date-time is prohibited`
  - If `start_date` is defined, an optional `end_date` may be specified.
  - If `start_datetime` is defined, an optional `end_datetime` may be specified.

| -------------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| start_date     | 0..1        | `string` | The start date of the event in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.                                             |
| start_datetime | 0..1        | `string` | The start datetime of the event in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2024-12-01T10:00:00Z`).              |
| end_date       | 0..1        | `string` | The end date of the event in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. This is optional if `start_date` is used.     |
| end_datetime   | 0..1        | `string` | The end datetime of the event in ISO 8601 format. This is optional if `start_datetime` is used. |

## Implementation Notes

### Date vs DateTime Specificity

The Event data type supports either Date or DateTime specificity. When choosing which specificity to transmit an Event,
consider the intent of the transmission, and whether the time component would aid in providing meaningful context to
the conveyed information. We offer the following guidance:

- Reporting normally uses day resolution. If you know your message is intended to be used for reporting purposes, use
  the `date` format over `date-time`.
- System logging and auditing uses should lean towards using the `date-time` format if the time component is available.
- When the usage intent is unknown and the time component is available, use the `date-time` format as it will contain
  a higher degree of information fidelity.

### Transformation Specificity

Conversion and inference between the `date` and `date-time` formats can be tricky as it is not possible to do a lossless
bidirectional transformation between the two formats (i.e. if you drop the time from date-time, you will have a hard
time getting the time value back).

- When converting from `date-time` to `date`, the transformation shall account for the timezone offset.
  - As all dates are recorded in UTC time, it is not sufficient to simply truncate the time portion.
  - Use the local time of the system where it is operating at as a frame of reference.
  - For most situations, anticipate using either Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) or Pacific Standard Time (PST).
- We advise against converting from `date` to `date-time` as assumptions for the time component would be necessary.

### Ongoing Events

The Event data type only supports representing a specific moment with just a start, or a finite duration with a start and an end. Event does not support conveying an ongoing event (e.g. there exists a start date, but no end date is
provided because it is still current or ongoing). This is because the message specification needs to support
asynchronous communication workloads; it may be possible for an ongoing event to no longer hold true by the time the
message has been parsed by the recipient system.

While inferences may be made about values that only have the start defined, they should not be interpreted when
handling their values, and should instead be used "at face value" to describe only the specific moment when a start
occurs.
