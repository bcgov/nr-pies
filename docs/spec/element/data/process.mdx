Represents a process tracking concept.

## Scope

This data type is intended to represent the core concept of a defined process.

Loosely taking inspiration from [HL7 Timing](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#timing).

## Structure

Fundamentally, a Process is a representation of a defined process tracking concept. It is, at minimum, an in-line composition of
a [Coding](/docs/spec/element/data/coding) element and an optional set of status related attributes.

- A Process element leverages the [Coding](/docs/spec/element/data/coding#structure) element structure.
- A Process may contain a `status` attribute.
  - The `status` attribute acts as a free text field which represents the specific status value that may be stored or
    encoded in the transmitting system.
  - If `status` is defined, the `status_code` and `status_description` attributes may optionally be defined as well.
  - Both `status_code` and `status_description` attributes shall not be defined if the `status` attribute is not present.

There are certain nuances for recipient systems to be aware of when processing the process element.

- Recipient systems shall primarily rely on the [Coding](/docs/spec/element/data/coding) elements in this Process element (i.e. the `code`, `code_set` and `code_system` attributes).
  - Recipient systems may elect to parse the `status`, `status_code` and `status_description` attributes as auxiliary or supplementary data.
  - Recipient systems shall not depend on these attributes as they are not guaranteed to exist, nor do they convey the
    standard concept hierarchy as defined by this specification.

## Implementation Notes

The core of the process type is the structural representation of some form of a process tracking concept. The process
type is conceptually aligned with the [Process Tracking Code System](/docs/spec/code_system/process_tracking) to
represent the various levels of abstractions that are possible. The hierarchical nature of these abstractions are mapped
via the [Application Process Concept Map](/docs/spec/concept_map/application_process) to represent the various levels of
abstraction that are possible.

Process tracking itself is a complex domain as it involves many different contexts and levels of abstraction. One of
the Code Systems that leverage this data element is the
[Application Process Code System](/docs/spec/code_system/application_process). This is represented through a standard
[Coding](/docs/spec/element/data/coding) element structure. In the Coding element, there is a `code`, a `code_set` and a
`code_system` attribute.

The `code` attribute is the primary code value, while the `code_set` attribute is an ordered
set of code symbols. The `code_set` attribute is an ordered set of code symbols, where the last element must match the
`code`. For example, the `code_set` value of `["APPLICATION", "TECH_REVIEW_COMMENT", "REFERRAL"]` would indicate that
the application process concept being conveyed is representing the `REFERRAL` State within the
`Technical Review and Comment` Stage of an `Application` Phase. This coding element would have a `code` of `REFERRAL` as
it is the most specific and primary concept being conveyed.

The `code_set` attribute may be populated with fewer elements in situations where the concept being mapped represents a
higher level conceptual abstraction. For example, if the `code` attribute is "TECH_REVIEW_COMMENT", the `code_set`
would have a value of `["APPLICATION", "TECH_REVIEW_COMMENT"]`. In this case, this means that the conceptual idea being
conveyed is the `Technical Review and Comment` Stage of an `Application` Phase. Systems reading the `code_set` attribute
may extract a subset of the transmitted ordered array for processing since the lower level codes map to higher level
hierarchical code concepts within the [Application Process Code System](/docs/spec/code_system/application_process).

The `code_system` attribute is a static URI reference to the documentation for the current code system being used. This
URI is not intended to be machine readable as it is designed to act as a signal for human readers to see and understand
the context of which terminologies and concepts are being conveyed.

The `status` attribute is optional, but is designed to be an explicit "escape hatch" for specific lines of business to
share their most detailed system concepts, should they choose to do so. Statuses declared here will be implicitly
mapped under the `code` attribute. If a `status` is defined, the `status_code` and `status_description` attributes may
also be defined in order to assist with clarifying the status value.

Recipient systems may look at `status`, `status_code` and `status_description` as a reference point. However, the core
intent of this data type is to ensure that the core `code` and `code_set` attributes are to be the main source of truth
when handling and interpreting the data for processing. Recipient systems SHOULD NOT depend on either `status`,
`status_code` or `status_description` attributes when parsing and interpreting the process concept.
