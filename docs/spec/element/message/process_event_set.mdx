Represents a set of process events associated to a specific record.

## Scope

This message type is intended to represent a set of temporal events within a defined process. This will commonly be
used for situations where acquiring a record's process history is required, such as for auditing, reporting or
compliance purposes.

Note that this message type does not guarantee nor expect all known or related ProcessEvents to be present. It is
possible for this message to only contain a subset of all known ProcessEvents.

## Structure

A Process Event Set shall contain every standard message [Header](/docs/spec/element/data/header#structure) property, in addition to
the following properties:

| Name          | Cardinality | Type                                                      | Description & Constraints                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| process_event | 1..1        | [ProcessEvent](/docs/spec/element/resource/process_event) | A set of ProcessEvents. Represents a set of process concepts at a specific event in time. |

    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Implementation Notes

The Process Event Set message type is designed to act as an aggregation of [ProcessEvent](/docs/spec/element/resource/process_event)s. Systems creating this message type should provide all known ProcessEvents associated to a record where possible. Recipient systems should not assume that the message will provide the full data horizon of all ProcessEvents. If he full data horizon is required, recipient systems must ensure that they request for any other relevant ProcessEventSets that may come from associated records.
