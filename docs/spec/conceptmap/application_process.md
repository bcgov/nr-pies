## Content

Mapping from [Application Process Code System](/docs/spec/codesystem/application_process.md) to
[Process Tracking Code System](/docs/spec/codesystem/process_tracking.md).

### Mapping

This is a mapping between the Application Process levels and the Process Tracking code words.

| Source Code | Relationship                                                          | Target Code |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `1`         | [Equivalent](/docs/spec/codesystem/concept_map_relationship#concepts) | `phase`     |
| `2`         | [Equivalent](/docs/spec/codesystem/concept_map_relationship#concepts) | `stage`     |
| `3`         | [Equivalent](/docs/spec/codesystem/concept_map_relationship#concepts) | `state`     |
| `4`         | [Equivalent](/docs/spec/codesystem/concept_map_relationship#concepts) | `status`    |

## Errata

Level 4, or status, is not explicitly defined in the Application Process, as that level behaves as a LoB escape hatch
and is not a part of that formal Code System.
