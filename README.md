## Installation Guide

This section outlines how to quickly set up and run the Docusaurus site locally.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your machine before you can proceed:

- Install [Node.js 22 LTS](https://nodejs.org) or higher
- Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Install VSCode [Recommended Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_workspace-recommended-extensions)
  - This can be done by searching `@recommended` in the Extensions tab, and then
    clicking the `Install Workspace Recommended Extensions` button.

### Install

```sh
npm ci
```

This command installs the dependencies as defined by the lockfile.

### Run Local Development

```sh
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Static Build

```sh
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.

### Versioning

Releasing a version requires the following actions to be done in order:

1. Run `npm version` with argument `patch`, `minor` or `major` depending on the
   desired outcome (e.g. `npm version minor`).
2. Run `npm run version` with the semver version to be published (e.g.
   `npm run version 0.1.0`). This will create a new Docusaurus version, and run a
   script to align all the schema references appropriately.

_Note: You may run `npm run postversion` directly in the event you need to
manually align all the schema references._

---

### Deployment Notes

The following steps are not necessary in order to contribute to PIES as this
repository contains a dedicated CI/CD pipeline.

Using SSH:

```sh
USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```sh
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to
build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
